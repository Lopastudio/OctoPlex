Create an interactive interface for the Academy databases
developed within the Database Theory course. This interface
should allow the user to:
■ Insert rows into database tables;  ✅
■ Update rows in the database tables;
■ Delete rows from the database tables;
■ Create reports:
• Print information about all study groups;
• Print information about all teachers;
• Print full names of the teachers who give lectures to a
specific group;
• Print department names and group names that belong
to them;
• Print the department with the largest number of groups;
• Print the department with the smallest number of groups;
• Print names of academic disciplines taught by a specific
teacher;
• Print departments to which a specific discipline belongs;
• Print group names that belong to a specific sub-department;
• Print names of the disciplines and full names of the teachers who give the largest number of lectures;
• Print the name of a discipline with the least number of
lectures. 
  Provide the ability to print the result of the report or save
it to a file (the user chooses the desired option in the app
settings).
■ Provide the ability to enter the app with different access
rights. For example, read-only, read and write, read specific
tables only.
